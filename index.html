            <h3>What is a Kimono?</h3>
            <p>Kimono literally means “something that is worn” – but there are many types of kimono worn on different occasions. <br>
                The basis of the kimono is, of course, the kimono robe itself. There are various kimono patterns and colors
                to match the seasons, but there is also a stark difference in types of kimono. We offer a variety of 9 types
                of traditional Kimono.</p>

                    <p>the most formal type of kimono, the furisode. The furisode is worn by unmarried women and has sleeves
                        between 100cm- 107cm long. There are actually three different types of furisode with different sleeve
                        lengths; the Kofurisode (小振袖) with short sleeves, the Chu-furisode (中振袖) with medium sleeves and
                        the Ofurisode(大振袖) where the sleeves almost reach the ground. The most common furisode is the Ofurisode.</p>

                    <h4>Hikizuri (引きずり)</h4>
                    <p>Before the Meiji era, Hikizuri kimono was worn by affluent women of high rank. The chances you will see
                        this kimono in public are very slim unless you are in Kyoto or the Asakusa area of Tokyo. Hikizuri
                        means “trailing skirt” and the kimono got this name because of its length. Currently, this type of
                        kimono is mainly worn by geisha, maiko or stage performers of traditional Japanese dance. With modern
                        times, women had more opportunities to leave the house which resulted in the current style that requires
                        folding the extra fabric around the waist.</p>

                        and unmarried women. The pattern flows over the shoulder to the seams in the back and is visible
                        on the sleeves and under the waist.</p>

                        town, or small celebrations. This was the most common way to dress before Western clothes became
                        popular in Japan.</p>

                    <p>This is a pure white kimono worn by the bride. The official name for the dress is ‘Shiromuki’. The white
                        color of the kimono dates back to the days of the samurai, when a woman would show her submission
                        to the family she was marrying into. Being white, it meant she could easily blend into the family’s
                        colors.

                        Men’s kimono are simpler in construction and the colors are more subdued. The most formal men’s kimono
                        is a combination of a hakama (kimono pants) and Haori (kimono jacket). The most common men’s kimono
                        is simply worn with an obi belt tied around the waist and it is known as kinagashi.</p>
